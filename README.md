The challenge is correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images in the MNIST  dataset, which has been a reliable resource for benchmarking classification algorithms since its release in 1999. The goal is to gain first-hand knowledge of what works well and how various techniques compare to each other.
